# C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Learning Code

This repository contains C++ programs that demonstrate the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The programs are created as part of the learning process to understand key OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

---

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Classes and Objects
- Introduction to creating classes and objects.
- Demonstrates how to define and use member variables and functions.

### 2. Encapsulation
- Demonstrates the use of access specifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) to protect data within a class.
- Includes getter and setter functions for encapsulating data.

### 3. Inheritance
- Shows how classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.
- Demonstrates single and multiple inheritance (if applicable).

### 4. Polymorphism
- Demonstrates function overloading and overriding.
- Includes virtual functions and runtime polymorphism.

### 5. Abstraction
- Introduction to abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
- Demonstrates hiding implementation details while exposing necessary interfaces.

### 6. Constructors and Destructors
- Demonstrates constructor overloading.
- Shows the use of destructors to manage memory and resources.
